facebook.js
===========

What is facebook.js
-------------------
facebook.js is my attempt to let you take control over your facebook account.

Features
--------
* Only show your online friends in the chat panel. All other friends are still reachable by searching below.
* Get rid of new chat panel entirely, and go back to the classic chat look.

Installing
----------
To use facebook.js, download the addon for IE/Firefox/Chrome
https://github.com/TalAter/facebook.js/raw/master/facebookjs.exe

Or, for the more techno-geeky, you can inject the code directly in your browser console.
